## System requirements
1. R environment (currently using R 3.2.0 - R packages employed for analysis,
are listed in file `./160621_package_citations.bib`. This file can be opened
with most common reference managers)
2. Bash shell (OSX 10.10.5) - Should you work in a different environment consider
adopting the line endings of files as well as syntax differences in tools such as
`sed` or `grep`.
4. MacQiime (Qiime 1.8., later versions of Qiime may have slight syntax differences).


## Contents

### Directories
- `0_AU_SOIL_biom_files_18S/`: `.biom` files for 18S data from Australian soils
generated with variable thresholds as described in the manuscript.
- `0_AU_SOIL_biom_files_COI/`: `.biom` files for COI data from Australian soils
generated with variable thresholds as described in the manuscript.
- `1_AU_MOCK_biom_files_18S/`: `.biom` files for 18S data from Insect blends
generated with variable thresholds as described in the manuscript.
- `1_AU_MOCK_biom_files_COI/`: `.biom` files for COI data from Insect blends
generated with variable thresholds as described in the manuscript.
- `2_ANT_SOIL_biom_18S/`: `.biom` files for 18S data from Antarctic soils
generated with variable thresholds as described in the manuscript.
- `2_ANT_SOIL_biom_COI/`: `.biom` files for COI data from Antarctic soils

- `3_ANT_MORPH/`: `.biom` files containing information from morphological assessments of
Antarctic soil samples.
- `4_rep_sets/`: compressed `.fasta` files containing relevant sequences for 18S and COI data sets
(as indicated in file `./160121_file_collation_for_upload.txt`).
